### This is where the code for our project will be held
### Each person should work within the BRANCH that relates to their code
### ONLY when EVERYONE is finished with their code is anything to be pushed to the main branch
### The main branch serves as our final revision (aka version 1 and beyond)
### Updates to the code within side branches are considered major changes (aka version 0.3, version 1.4 etc.)
### Refactoring attempts are considered minor changes (aka version 0.4.1, version 2.1.3 etc.)
### Anytime you do a major/minor change, especially to requirement functionality, you should record it in the version control table of our requirements document.
### > It would also be good to have a txt file to keep track of the things you need to work on/already completed.
### > A txt file with all the functions/classes you use would also be helpful
### It would be good to aim for two final version. One on by Nov 22, and the last on Nov 27. That gives us enough time to ensure the code works and covers most of the document
